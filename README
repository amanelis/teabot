ZTBot, written by Alex Manelis <amanelis@gmail.com>
This is a twitter bot designed to be run with cron
on a php server.

There are only two files that need to be edited before
you can use the twitter bot. Add your user name and 
password to this file:

config.inc.php

Then edit the "username:password" text on line 60 in
the zandermane_bot.php file. This line you will need 
to manually enter in the bots username and password
at the end of the line.

Edit your search criteria on the bottom of the 
zandermane_bot.php file to what you will be searching
for and tweeting back to about. Also add some personal
quotes you want your bot to tweet back in the getQuote()
function in zandermane_bot.php.
